# Library-Management-System
A simple and beginner-friendly Library Management System built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and SQLite. It allows users to add, view, and delete books with a clean and responsive interface. The backend provides fast and secure CRUD APIs using Express, while the SQLite database stores all book records locally.
